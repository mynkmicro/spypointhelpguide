Understanding Your Spypoint Account
====================================

Your account acts as the control center for managing connected trail cameras, reviewing captured images, and monitoring device activity. After signing in, you can adjust camera settings, check battery status, manage photo transmission plans, and update personal details.

Having secure account access ensures your devices remain properly synced and your data stays protected.

After updating your password, return to the sign in page and enter your new credentials.

Common Login Issues and Solutions

Review connected devices periodically and remove any unfamiliar activity. Updating your password if you suspect unusual access adds an additional layer of protection.
